# Mogzi FlexColumnTuiApp Refactoring Implementation Plan

## Overview

This directory contains the detailed implementation plans for refactoring the `FlexColumnTuiApp` class using a hybrid architectural approach combining State Pattern, Mediator Pattern, Component Pattern, and Strategy Pattern. The refactoring is designed to improve maintainability, testability, performance, and extensibility while preserving all existing functionality.

## Refactoring Approach

### Recommended Architecture: Hybrid State + Mediator + Component Pattern

The refactoring uses a **hybrid approach** that combines:

1. **State Pattern** for core application states (Input, Thinking, ToolExecution)
2. **Mediator Pattern** for coordinating between components and managing complex interactions
3. **Component Pattern** for UI modularity and reusability
4. **Strategy Pattern** for rendering different UI contexts

This combination is ideal for TUI applications because:
- **State Pattern** naturally maps to the distinct UI modes
- **Mediator** reduces coupling between the many interacting components
- **Component Pattern** enables modular UI composition
- **Strategy Pattern** handles the varied rendering requirements

## Implementation Phases

### [Phase 1: Foundation and State Extraction](implement_phase_1.md) (2-3 weeks)
**Goal**: Extract state management and establish core interfaces

**Key Deliverables:**
- `ITuiState`, `ITuiContext`, `ITuiStateManager` interfaces
- `InputTuiState`, `ThinkingTuiState`, `ToolExecutionTuiState` implementations
- `TuiStateManager` concrete implementation
- Refactored `FlexColumnTuiApp` with 40% size reduction
- Updated dependency injection configuration

**Success Metrics:**
- All state-specific logic extracted into separate classes
- State transitions work correctly
- No functional regressions
- 80% test coverage for new components

### [Phase 2: Component Extraction and Mediator Introduction](implement_phase_2.md) (3-4 weeks)
**Goal**: Break down monolithic rendering into components and introduce mediator

**Key Deliverables:**
- `ITuiComponent`, `ITuiPanel`, `ITuiMediator` interfaces
- `InputPanel`, `AutocompletePanel`, `UserSelectionPanel`, `ProgressPanel`, `FooterPanel`, `WelcomePanel` components
- `FlexColumnMediator` and `TuiComponentManager` implementations
- `FlexColumnLayout` layout system
- Additional 30% reduction in `FlexColumnTuiApp` size (70% total)

**Success Metrics:**
- Modular, reusable UI components
- All component interactions go through mediator
- Components can be composed into different layouts
- No performance regressions

### [Phase 3: Migrate Remaining]
**Goal**: Achieve functional parity with the legacy application implementation

**Key Deliverables:**
- To be determined (HELP)

**Success Metrics:**
- Implementation Strictly adheres to the target architecture and design
- No dead code
- All Legacy TUI App features are have a standalone Acceptance Test (black box style, no mocking)
- All Acceptance Tests pass
- All Manual adhoc tests pass
- User is 100% satisfied with application behavior when running via `dotnet run`
  
## Progress Tracking

Each phase document contains:
1. **Description of Work**: Detailed work items and deliverables
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Functional, technical, and quality requirements
3. **Definition of Done**: Scaled Agile Framework compliance
4. **Progress Section**: Real-time progress tracking with status tables

### Status Legend
- **Not Started**: âšª
- **In Progress**: ðŸŸ¡
- **Completed**: âœ…
- **Blocked**: ðŸ”´

## Getting Started

1. **Review Phase 1**: Start with [implement_phase_1.md](implement_phase_1.md)
2. **Set Up Environment**: Ensure development environment is ready
3. **Create Feature Branch**: Create a dedicated branch for the refactoring
4. **Begin Implementation**: Follow the detailed work items in Phase 1
5. **Track Progress**: Update the progress section as work is completed



This phased approach ensures that the refactoring delivers value incrementally while maintaining the stability and functionality that makes Mogzi effective.
