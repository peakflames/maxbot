# Phase 2: Component Extraction and Mediator Introduction

## Description of Work to be Performed

### Overview
This phase focuses on breaking down the monolithic rendering logic into modular, reusable components and introducing a mediator pattern to coordinate interactions between components. The goal is to create a flexible, composable UI system that reduces coupling and improves maintainability.

### Detailed Work Items

#### 1. Create Component Framework (Week 1)
- **ITuiComponent Interface**: Define the contract for all UI components
  - `Name` property for component identification
  - `Render()` method for component-specific rendering
  - `HandleInputAsync()` for component input handling
  - `IsVisible` property for visibility management

- **ITuiPanel Interface**: Define container components
  - Extends `ITuiComponent` with child management
  - `AddChild()`, `RemoveChild()` methods
  - `Children` collection for hierarchical composition

- **IRenderContext Interface**: Provide rendering context
  - Access to current state, input context, theme information
  - Shared rendering utilities and helpers

#### 2. Extract Core UI Components (Week 1-2)
- **InputPanel**: Extract from `CreateFlexInputComponent()`
  - Handle cursor positioning and text display
  - Support different input modes (normal, editing)
  - Manage input validation and formatting

- **AutocompletePanel**: Extract from `CreateInputWithAutocomplete()`
  - Display suggestion list with selection highlighting
  - Handle navigation and selection logic
  - Support different completion types (files, commands)

- **UserSelectionPanel**: Extract from `CreateInputWithUserSelection()`
  - Display interactive selection options
  - Handle option navigation and selection
  - Support different selection providers

- **ProgressPanel**: Extract from thinking/tool execution components
  - Display animated progress indicators
  - Show operation status and duration
  - Support different progress types (thinking, tool execution)

- **FooterPanel**: Extract from `CreateFlexFooterComponent()`
  - Display status information (directory, model, tokens)
  - Handle dynamic status updates
  - Support configurable status items

- **WelcomePanel**: Extract from `CreateWelcomeMessage()`
  - Display welcome message and branding
  - Support customizable welcome content
  - Handle initial application state

#### 3. Create Mediator System (Week 2)
- **ITuiMediator Interface**: Define coordination contract
  - `HandleUserInputAsync()` for user input coordination
  - `HandleKeyPressAsync()` for keyboard event coordination
  - `HandleStateChangeAsync()` for state transition coordination
  - `HandleToolExecutionAsync()` for tool execution coordination
  - `NotifyComponentAsync()` for component communication

- **FlexColumnMediator Class**: Concrete mediator implementation
  - Coordinate between components and services
  - Manage complex interaction workflows
  - Handle cross-component communication
  - Maintain application-wide state consistency

#### 4. Implement Component Management (Week 2-3)
- **ITuiComponentManager Interface**: Define component lifecycle management
  - `RegisterComponent()` for component registration
  - `GetComponent()` for component lookup
  - `RenderLayout()` for layout composition
  - `BroadcastInputAsync()` for input distribution

- **TuiComponentManager Class**: Concrete component manager
  - Component registration and lifecycle management
  - Layout composition and rendering coordination
  - Input event distribution to relevant components
  - Component visibility and state management

#### 5. Create Layout System (Week 3)
- **ITuiLayout Interface**: Define layout contracts
  - `Name` property for layout identification
  - `Compose()` method for component arrangement
  - `GetRequiredComponents()` for dependency specification

- **FlexColumnLayout Class**: Main application layout
  - Arrange components in flexible column structure
  - Handle dynamic content area management
  - Support responsive layout adjustments

#### 6. Refactor FlexColumnTuiApp (Week 3-4)
- Remove component-specific rendering logic
- Delegate to component manager and mediator
- Maintain only high-level coordination:
  - Application lifecycle management
  - Service provider coordination
  - Event subscription management
  - Error handling and logging

#### 7. Update Dependency Injection (Week 4)
- Register component interfaces and implementations
- Configure component manager and mediator
- Ensure proper service lifetimes and dependencies
- Update service configuration for new architecture

#### 8. Testing and Integration (Week 4)
- Create unit tests for each component
- Create integration tests for mediator interactions
- Test component composition and layout rendering
- Validate all existing functionality preserved

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Component Isolation**: Each UI element is handled by a separate, testable component
2. **Component Composition**: Components can be composed into different layouts
3. **Mediator Coordination**: All component interactions go through the mediator
4. **Input Distribution**: Input events are properly distributed to relevant components
5. **Layout Flexibility**: Different layouts can be composed from the same components

### Technical Requirements
1. **Interface Compliance**: All components implement required interfaces correctly
2. **Mediator Pattern**: All cross-component communication goes through mediator
3. **Component Lifecycle**: Proper component registration, initialization, and cleanup
4. **Memory Management**: No memory leaks in component creation/destruction
5. **Thread Safety**: Component manager handles concurrent access safely

### Quality Requirements
1. **Code Reduction**: `FlexColumnTuiApp` class size reduced by additional 30% (70% total)
2. **Component Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts
3. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for new components
4. **Performance**: No performance regression in rendering or input handling
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between components and coordination logic
