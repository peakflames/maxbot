# Phase 1: Foundation and State Extraction

## Description of Work to be Performed

### Overview
This phase focuses on extracting the state management logic from the monolithic `FlexColumnTuiApp` class and establishing the foundational interfaces for the new architecture. The goal is to implement the State Pattern to handle the three primary application states: Input, Thinking, and ToolExecution.

### Detailed Work Items

#### 1. Create Core Interfaces (Week 1)
- **ITuiState Interface**: Define the contract for all application states
  - `Name` property for state identification
  - `RenderDynamicContent()` method for state-specific rendering
  - `HandleKeyPress()` and `HandleCharacterTyped()` for input handling
  - `OnEnterAsync()` and `OnExitAsync()` for state lifecycle management

- **ITuiContext Interface**: Provide shared context for states
  - Access to `InputContext`, `IServiceProvider`, `ILogger`
  - Shared state and configuration access
  - Event notification capabilities

- **ITuiStateManager Interface**: Manage state transitions
  - Current state tracking
  - State transition logic
  - Input delegation to current state

#### 2. Implement State Classes (Week 1-2)
- **InputTuiState**: Handle normal input, autocomplete, and user selection modes
  - Extract logic from `CreateFlexInputComponent()`, `CreateInputWithAutocomplete()`, `CreateInputWithUserSelection()`
  - Handle keyboard input for normal typing, cursor movement, history navigation
  - Manage autocomplete and user selection state transitions

- **ThinkingTuiState**: Handle AI processing state
  - Extract logic from `CreateFlexThinkingComponent()`
  - Handle escape key for cancellation
  - Manage animation timing and duration display

- **ToolExecutionTuiState**: Handle tool execution display
  - Extract logic from `CreateFlexToolExecutionComponent()`
  - Handle tool progress updates and display
  - Manage tool execution lifecycle

#### 3. Create State Manager Implementation (Week 2)
- **TuiStateManager Class**: Concrete implementation of state management
  - State registration and lookup
  - Thread-safe state transitions
  - Event propagation to current state
  - State lifecycle management

#### 4. Refactor FlexColumnTuiApp (Week 2-3)
- Remove state-specific switch statements from:
  - `RenderDynamicContent()`
  - `OnKeyPressed()`
  - `OnCharacterTyped()`
  - `HandleEscapeKey()`
- Delegate all state-specific operations to `ITuiStateManager`
- Maintain coordination logic for:
  - Service provider management
  - Event subscription/unsubscription
  - Application lifecycle (startup/shutdown)

#### 5. Update Dependency Injection (Week 3)
- Register new interfaces and implementations
- Ensure proper service lifetimes (singleton for state manager, transient for states)
- Update service configuration to support new architecture

#### 6. Testing and Validation (Week 3)
- Create unit tests for each state class
- Create integration tests for state transitions
- Validate all existing functionality works unchanged
- Performance testing to ensure no regression

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **State Isolation**: Each application state (Input, Thinking, ToolExecution) is handled by a separate, testable class
2. **State Transitions**: All state transitions work correctly and maintain application flow
3. **Input Handling**: Keyboard input is properly delegated to the current state and handled appropriately
4. **Rendering**: Dynamic content rendering works for all states with no visual regressions
5. **Lifecycle Management**: State enter/exit logic is properly executed during transitions

### Technical Requirements
1. **Interface Compliance**: All state classes implement `ITuiState` interface correctly
2. **Dependency Injection**: New components are properly registered and resolved
3. **Thread Safety**: State manager handles concurrent access safely
4. **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling and logging throughout state system
5. **Memory Management**: No memory leaks in state transitions or lifecycle management

### Quality Requirements
1. **Code Reduction**: `FlexColumnTuiApp` class size reduced by at least 40%
2. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Reduced complexity in main application class
3. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for new state classes
4. **Performance**: No performance regression in UI responsiveness
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between states
