# Phase 3: Finalization and Feature Parity

## Description of Work to be Performed

### Overview
This final phase focuses on achieving full functional parity with the legacy `LegacyFlexColumnTuiApp` implementation, with a strong emphasis on testing and stability. The primary goal is to address all identified gaps and ensure that the new architecture is robust, reliable, and fully functional.

### Detailed Work Items

#### 1. UI/UX Stabilization (High Priority)
- **Fix Welcome Screen Rendering:**
  - Ensure the terminal is cleared before the welcome screen is displayed.
  - Resolve the conflict between the thinking animation and the welcome message to prevent the welcome message from being overwritten.
- **Resolve Rendering Conflicts:**
  - Investigate and fix the underlying issue causing the static scrollback area and the dynamic content area to conflict. This will likely involve changes to `ScrollbackTerminal` and the main rendering loop in `FlexColumnTuiApp`.
- **Stabilize Tool Execution UI:**
  - Redesign the rendering flow for tool execution to ensure tool calls, assistant responses, and progress indicators are displayed clearly and in the correct order.
  - Fix the UI "fighting" where different elements overwrite each other during tool use. This will involve `ToolExecutionTuiState`, `ToolExecutionDisplay`, and the `FlexColumnMediator`.

#### 2. Implement Session Management and Chat History (Week 1)
- Implement `ChatHistoryService` to persist chat history across sessions.
- Integrate session management into the `FlexColumnTuiApp`.
- Remove "TODO" comments related to session management.

#### 3. Ensure Feature Parity (Week 1-2)
- Conduct a thorough comparison of the `FlexColumnTuiApp` and `LegacyFlexColumnTuiApp` to identify any missing features.
- Implement any missing features in the new architecture.
- Pay close attention to small details and edge cases.

#### 4. Improve Tool Execution Display (Week 2)
- Update `ToolExecutionDisplay.cs` to extract the filename from tool arguments.
- Enhance the tool execution display to provide more context to the user.

#### 5. Perform Dead Code Analysis (Week 2)
- Use a code analysis tool to identify any dead code in the `Mogzi.TUI` project.
- Remove any identified dead code.

#### 6. Comprehensive Testing (Week 3-4)
- Write unit tests for all new components, with a minimum of 80% code coverage.
- Write integration tests for all major features.
- **Crucially, expand black-box acceptance tests to cover the reported UI/UX issues, including chat-only and complex tool-use scenarios.**
- All tests must pass before the refactoring is considered complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1.  **Stable and Smooth UI:** The user interface is free of rendering artifacts, flickering, or conflicts between static and dynamic content, especially during state transitions and tool execution.
2.  **Full Feature Parity:** The new implementation has all the features of the legacy implementation.
3.  **Session Management:** Chat history is persisted across sessions.
4.  **Improved Tool Display:** The tool execution display is clear and informative.

### Technical Requirements
1.  **No Dead Code:** All dead code has been removed from the `Mogzi.TUI` project.
2.  **High Test Coverage:** All new components have at least 80% unit test coverage.
3.  **All Tests Pass:** All unit, integration, and acceptance tests pass.

### Quality Requirements
1.  **Stability:** The application is stable and free of crashes.
2.  **Performance:** The application is responsive and performs well.
3.  **Maintainability:** The code is clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain.
