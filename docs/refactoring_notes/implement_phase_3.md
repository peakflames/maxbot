# Phase 3: Finalization and Feature Parity

## Description of Work to be Performed

### Overview
This final phase focuses on achieving full functional parity with the legacy `LegacyFlexColumnTuiApp` implementation, with a strong emphasis on testing and stability. The primary goal is to address all identified gaps and ensure that the new architecture is robust, reliable, and fully functional.

### Detailed Work Items

#### 1. UI/UX Stabilization (High Priority) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **✅ Message Boundary Detection System Implemented:**
  - **Root Cause Identified**: All streaming content (text + tool calls + tool results) was being appended to a single ChatMessage, causing poor message boundaries and unclear conversation flow.
  - **Solution Implemented**: Created a comprehensive Message Boundary Detection System in `FlexColumnMediator` that:
    - **Content Type Classification**: Distinguishes between Text, FunctionCall, and FunctionResult content types
    - **Smart Boundary Detection**: Automatically creates new ChatMessage objects when content type transitions occur
    - **Non-deterministic AI Handling**: Robustly handles both AI behavior patterns (Text→Tools→Text vs Tools→Text)
    - **Message Factory Pattern**: Properly constructs ChatMessage objects for different content types
    - **Content Validation**: Prevents empty or meaningless messages from cluttering history
  - **Testing Strategy**: Enhanced black-box acceptance test validates proper message sequencing and boundaries
  - **User Verification**: Independently confirmed by user with visual evidence of proper message separation
- **✅ Tool Execution UI Stabilized:**
  - Tool calls, assistant responses, and progress indicators now display clearly and in correct order
  - Eliminated UI "fighting" where different elements overwrote each other during tool use
  - Proper separation between user messages, assistant summaries, and tool execution results
- **✅ Rendering Conflicts Resolved:**
  - Static scrollback area and dynamic content area now work harmoniously
  - Message boundaries create clear visual separation in conversation flow
  - Professional chat interface matching user expectations for modern AI assistants

#### 2. Implement Session Management and Chat History (Week 1)
- Implement `ChatHistoryService` to persist chat history across sessions.
  - Use the `Cline` AI assistant to draw critical understanding of the complexity to implementing this feature.
- Integrate session management into the `FlexColumnTuiApp`.
- Remove "TODO" comments related to session management.

#### 3. Ensure Feature Parity (Week 1-2)
- **✅ Debug Logging Cleanup Completed:**
  - **Issue**: Excessive LogTrace statements were added during debugging of slash command acceptance tests, creating noise in logs
  - **Solution**: Systematically reduced debug logging volume to only essential statements needed for test execution
  - **Files Cleaned**: 13 files across State, App, Infrastructure, and Components layers
  - **Types Removed**: Component initialization logging, verbose state transition logging, excessive key handling debug statements
  - **Verification**: All 4 slash command acceptance tests continue to pass after cleanup (`/exit`, `/quit`, `/help`, `/tool-approvals`)
  - **Priority Rationale**: User prioritized this cleanup over session management as it was affecting code maintainability
- Conduct a thorough comparison of the `FlexColumnTuiApp` and `LegacyFlexColumnTuiApp` to identify any missing features.
- Implement any missing features in the new architecture.
- Pay close attention to small details and edge cases.

#### 4. Improve Tool Execution Display (Week 2)
- Update `ToolExecutionDisplay.cs` to extract the filename from tool arguments.
- Enhance the tool execution display to provide more context to the user.

#### 5. Perform Dead Code Analysis (Week 2)
- Use a code analysis tool to identify any dead code in the `Mogzi.TUI` project.
- Remove any identified dead code.

#### 6. Comprehensive Testing (Week 3-4)
- Use a code coverage tool to determine code coverage using existing tests
- All tests must pass before the refactoring is considered complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1.  **Stable and Smooth UI:** The user interface is free of rendering artifacts, flickering, or conflicts between static and dynamic content, especially during state transitions and tool execution.
2.  **Full Feature Parity:** The new implementation has all the features of the legacy implementation.
3.  **Session Management:** Chat history is persisted across sessions.
4.  **Improved Tool Display:** The tool execution display is clear and informative.

### Technical Requirements
1.  **No Dead Code:** All dead code has been removed from the `Mogzi.TUI` project.
2.  **High Test Coverage:** All new components have at least 80% unit test coverage.
3.  **All Tests Pass:** All unit, integration, and acceptance tests pass.

### Quality Requirements
1.  **Stability:** The application is stable and free of crashes.
2.  **Performance:** The application is responsive and performs well.
3.  **Maintainability:** The code is clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain.
