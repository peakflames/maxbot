- **System command execution**: Cross-platform shell command execution with security controls
- **Chat history persistence**: Full session management with context preservation

### Security Implementation
- **Tool approval system**: Configurable readonly/all modes for destructive operations
- **Working directory constraints**: Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- **File permission respect**: Read-only file attribute checking

### Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests
- **Cross-platform support**: Windows, macOS, and Linux compatibility
- **Native AOT compatibility**: All dependencies verified for AOT compilation

### User Experience
- **Interactive chat mode**: Full conversational interface with streaming responses
- **Session management**: List, load, and continue previous conversations
- **Slash commands**: In-chat commands for configuration and session management

## Documentation Updates Completed

1. **Traceability Matrix** (`docs/specs/trace_matrix.md`):
   - Updated verification status for all 24 requirements
   - Marked Phase 1 as complete with 11/12 verified, 1/12 partially verified
   - Updated implementation components and test evidence

2. **Project Plan** (`docs/project_plan.md`):
   - Updated implementation status to 71% complete
   - Marked Phase 1 as complete
   - Defined Phase 2 priorities and next steps

3. **System Requirements** (`docs/specs/_index.md`):
   - Updated implementation status for all TORs
   - Corrected summary statistics to reflect actual progress

## Phase 2 Readiness

With Phase 1 complete, the system is ready to proceed to Phase 2 implementation. The next priorities are:

### High Priority Phase 2 Requirements
1. **TOR-2.2**: Planning and execution mode support
2. **TOR-5.2**: Task completion verification (attempt_completion tool)
3. **TOR-6.1**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) support
4. **TOR-1.3**: Enhanced action explanations (upgrade from partial)
5. **TOR-2.3**: Enhanced operation feedback (upgrade from partial)
6. **TOR-7.3**: Comprehensive input/output validation (upgrade from partial)
7. **TOR-8.1**: Response time limits and performance optimization

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Celebrate Phase 1 Achievement**: The team has successfully delivered a fully functional AI assistant system with comprehensive security controls
2. **Begin Phase 2 Planning**: Prioritize the 7 remaining high-priority requirements
3. **Maintain Documentation**: Continue updating traceability matrix as Phase 2 progresses

### Technical Recommendations
