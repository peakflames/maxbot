## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### External Dependencies
- **Spectre.Console** (Primary TUI library) - ⏳ Not Added
- **Spectre.Console.Markdig** (Markdown rendering) - ⏳ Not Added  
- **Spectre.Console.Extensions.Markup** (Syntax highlighting) - ⏳ Not Added
- **Spectre.Console.Testing** (Test framework) - ⏳ Not Added

### Internal Dependencies
- **Event System**: TuiEventBus and ITuiEvent interface implementation
- **Card Architecture**: ITuiCard interface and base implementations
- **Integration Points**: AppService event publishing, ConsoleRenderer event handling

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Spectre.Console AOT Compatibility**: Need to verify all required Spectre.Console packages are AOT-compatible
- **Event System Performance**: Synchronous event handling must maintain UI responsiveness
- **Integration Complexity**: TUI integration with existing CLI without breaking current functionality

### Mitigation Strategies
- **AOT Testing**: Validate AOT compatibility early in Phase 1
- **Incremental Integration**: Implement TUI as optional mode initially
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Use Spectre.Console.Testing for automated validation

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Spectre.Console successfully integrated and rendering basic text
- [ ] TuiEventBus operational with type-safe event handling
- [ ] TextCard rendering correctly in test environment
- [ ] Basic ConsoleRenderer layout established

### Overall TUI Success Criteria
- [ ] All 15 functional requirements (FR-TUI-1 through FR-TUI-15) implemented and tested
- [ ] All 13 test cases (TC-TUI-001 through TC-TUI-013) passing
- [ ] Non-functional requirements met (Performance, Usability, Robustness, Compatibility)
- [ ] Tool-to-card mapping fully operational for all AI tools
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed successfully

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Begin Phase 1, Task 1.1 - Setup Spectre.Console integration
2. **Validation**: Verify AOT compatibility of all Spectre.Console dependencies
3. **Architecture**: Implement TuiEventBus and ITuiEvent interface
4. **Testing**: Establish Spectre.Console.Testing framework and first test case
