![MAX Screenshot](./docs/assets/max_screenshot.png)

A Multi-model Autonomous eXpert (Max) right in your terminal or CI/CD pipeline and open to multiple API providers and AI models

Perform engineering research, full coding tasks, and multiple workflow with either natural language or shell scripts üëà

## Features ‚ú®

- Supports both `interactive chat` and `non-tnteractive` interface with streaming AI responses
- Currently supports the OpenAI-compatible APIs enabling numerous provides like Requesty.ai, Openrouter.ai, Supernova, Cerebras, Deepseek, and more.
   - For now, the `best` results are with models having excellect tool and instruction following like those form Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI models.
- Profile-based configuration for easy switching between providers and models
- Cross-platform support (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
- Control file system access via tool appproval (`readonly` or `all`)
- Chat history persistence to continue conversations across sessions (coming soon)
- Session management to list and load previous chat sessions (coming soon)
- MCP-Support (coming soon)

### Examples üí°

```bash
# Start a rich interactive chat
max

# Switch to using your profile named 'sonnet'
max --profile sonnet

# Translate a README.md to portugese in one shot
cat README.md | max run -p "Translate to portugese"

# (coming soon) Run a no non-interactive nworkflow prompt
max run -p workflows/generate-release-notes.md
```

## Prerequisites ‚úÖ

Before running the application, ensure you have:

- Access to at least one supported API provider
- Configuration file set up with your API providers and profiles

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

1. Download the latest release following the steps below.

   For Windows:

   - Download loads max.exe and moves it to your WindowsApp directory
   ```sh
   Start-BitsTransfer -Source https://github.com/peakflames/maxbot/releases/latest/download/max-win-x64.exe -Destination max.exe; move -Force max.exe $env:USERPROFILE\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps
   ```

    For MacOS (sudo):

    - Download loads max and moves it to your `/usr/local/bin`
  
    ```sh
    sudo curl -L -o max https://github.com/peakflames/maxbot/releases/latest/download/max-osx-x64 && sudo chmod +x max && sudo mv -f max /usr/local/bin
    ```

    For Linux (sudo)

    - Download loads max and moves it to your `/usr/local/bin`

    ```sh
    sudo curl -L -o max https://github.com/peakflames/maxbot/releases/latest/download/max-linux-x64 && sudo chmod +x max && sudo mv -f max /usr/local/bin
    ```

2. In your home directory, create a configuration file (`maxbot.config.json`) with your API provider details:

   ```json
   {
       "maxbotConfig": {
           "apiProviders": [
               {
                    "name": "MyCompanyProvider",
                    "type": "OpenAI-Compatible",
                    "apiKey": "example-key",
                    "baseUrl": "https://litellm.mycompany.com"
                },
                {
                    "name": "RequestyAI",
                    "type": "OpenAI-Compatible",
                    "apiKey": "example-key",
                    "baseUrl": "https://router.requesty.ai/v1"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Deepseek",
                    "type": "OpenAI-Compatible",
                    "apiKey": "example-key",
                    "baseUrl": "https://api.deepseek.com"
                }
           ],
           "profiles": [
               {
                   "default": true,
                   "name": "Default",
                   "apiProvider": "MyCompanyProvider",
                   "modelId": "03-mini"
               },
               {
                   "name": "Sonnet",
                   "apiProvider": "RequestyAI",
                   "modelId": "vertex/anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet"
               },
               {
                    "name": "Gemini",
                    "apiProvider": "RequestyAI",
                    "modelId": "google/gemini-2.5-pro"
                },
                {
                    "name": "V3",
                    "apiProvider": "Deepseek",
                    "modelId": "deepseek-chat"
                }
           ]
       }
   }
   ```

### Configuration Schema ‚öôÔ∏è

The application uses a JSON configuration file with the following structure:

- **apiProviders**: List of available API providers
  - **name**: Unique identifier for the provider
  - **type**: Provider type (OpenAI-Compatible at this time, more to come)
  - **apiKey**: Your API key for the provider
  - **baseUrl**: Base URL for the API (for OpenAI-Compatible providers)

- **profiles**: List of available profiles
  - **default**: Whether this is the default profile (true/false)
  - **name**: Profile name
  - **apiProvider**: Name of the API provider to use (must match a provider name)
  - **modelId**: Model ID to use for chat completion

### Tool Approval üîí

MaxBot includes a tool approval feature to provide control over file system operations. This setting can be configured in your `maxbot.config.json` file or overridden at runtime with a command-line argument.

**Configuration:**

To set the default tool approval mode, add the `tool_approvals` property to your `maxbot.config.json`:

```json
{
    "maxbotConfig": {
        "tool_approvals": "all",
        "apiProviders": [ ... ],
        "profiles": [ ... ]
    }
}
```

**Command-Line Override:**

You can override the configuration file setting using the `--tool-approvals` or `-ta` argument:

```bash
max "Create a new file" -ta all
```

**Modes:**

*   `readonly`: (Default) MaxBot will ask for your permission before performing any write operations (e.g., creating or modifying files).
*   `all`: MaxBot is pre-approved to perform any file system operation without asking for confirmation.
